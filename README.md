# My React Portfolio

---

This is an example of a personal protfolio made using React and Node. The portfolio displays examples of work that I have done during the course of my bootcamp. Technologies used in this application are React, JavaScript, Node, HTML, JSX and CSS.

## Requirements

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section

WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## Usage

---

To use the application, the user must simply navigate to [the application](https://brandonelliott0530.github.io/my-react-portfolio/). When there, the user will be presented with the options of a Bio, Portfolio, Resume, and a contact page.

## Chanllenges in Development

---

The only struggles I had, were in the beginning while initially learning React. I know that I would still need to have more practice to become proficient. Otherwise, development wasn't really chanllenging, but deciding on a styling that I liked was what took the longest.
